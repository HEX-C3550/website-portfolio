The CSS classes used in this index.html file come from two sources:
<br>
Bootstrap 5: Classes like container, row, col-md-6, align-items-center, text-center, img-fluid, and table are all part of the Bootstrap CSS framework. They are being used to quickly create a responsive and styled layout.
<br>
Custom CSS (Likely defined in ./css/styles.css): Classes like section-block, hero-column-block, column-block, and footer are likely custom classes defined in the styles.css file to provide specific styling and structure to the portfolio website.
<br>
This combination of Bootstrap and custom CSS classes is a common approach to web development, leveraging the power of a CSS framework for layout and basic styling while adding custom styles for branding and specific design elements.

Structure of the page
<br>
This page is primarily divided into main and footer part.
    <br>
    1.main: This is the main content area of the page, encompassing all the sections like "Hero," "About Me," "Skills," etc.
    <br>
    2.footer: This is the footer section, containing copyright information.
<br>
The main element is further divided into several section elements, each representing a distinct content block on the page. Each <section> generally follows a similar pattern:
    <br>    
    1.section.section-block: This is the base class for all sections, likely providing some general styling.
    <br>
    2..container: A Bootstrap container to manage responsiveness and center the content.
    <br>
    3.Content Blocks (div elements): Inside the container, div elements are used to structure the content within each section, often using Bootstrap's grid system (row, col-md-*) for layout.
